# Welcome to My Weather App ðŸ‘‹

I built this Weather App using Expo. It delivers real-time weather updates and location-based forecasts in a simple, customizable interface.

## Get started on your copy

1. **Verify your Node.js version**: I developed with Node.js v22.12.0, but you can use v22.6.0 or higher.

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Launch the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   In the startup menu, choose one of these options to run the app:

   - Development build
   - Android emulator
   - iOS simulator
   - Expo Go (for quick testing)

4. **Start coding**

   Edit files under the **app** directory and see your changes live. This project uses file-based routing for easy navigation.

## Example Folder Structure

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ (auth)/            # Onboarding and auth screens
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ onboarding.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ (protected)/       # Authenticated screens
â”œâ”€â”€ (root)/            # Main layout and home screen
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ home.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx        # Global layout
â”œâ”€â”€ +not-found.tsx     # 404 fallback
â””â”€â”€ index.tsx          # Entry point
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                # Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/           # Layout wrappers (base, auth, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ shared/            # Header, footer, and other shared pieces
screens/
â”œâ”€â”€ home/              # Home screen sections (hero, features, testimonials)
â””â”€â”€ profile/           # Profile sections (user-info, activity-feed, settings)
assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/            # Logos, icons, backgrounds
â”œâ”€â”€ audio/             # Sound assets
â”œâ”€â”€ video/             # Video assets
â””â”€â”€ fonts/             # Custom font files
```

## Why this setup?

- Expo-powered for fast iteration on Android, iOS, and web.
- File-based routing keeps navigation intuitive.
- Modular components so you can swap or extend features easily.
